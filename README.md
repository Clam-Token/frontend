# What is CLAM?
CLAM is a staking token on the Binance Smart Chain with the goal to stand against income inequality in the world. By holding CLAM in your wallet, you earn the right to gather CLAM.
Every block on the Smart Chain, one CLAM is reserved for sharing. If the user with the most CLAM has a minimum balance of twice the gather price, the Network-Sharing will be paid by this user, if not, he pays with the half of his balance and the next wealthy user is searched to pay. This happens as long as all open sharing is payed out. The reserved CLAM will increase until someone uses the "Gather"-Button on CLAM main page. Gathering means, that CLAM reserved for sharing are going to paid out to all CLAM-Users.
CLAM has a total amount of 21000000 token. Through the redistribution, the total amount will be stable, all users can profit from the sharing and get new CLAM by holding CLAM.
